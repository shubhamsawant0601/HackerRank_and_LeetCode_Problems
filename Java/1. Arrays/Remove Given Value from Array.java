/*27. Remove Element
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length. For example if you return 2 with nums = [2,2,3,3] or nums = [2,2,0,0], your answer will be accepted.

class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int countOfval = 0;

        for(int i= 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i]==val){
               nums[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
               countOfval++;
            }
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        return nums.length-countOfval;
    }
}
